# CodeAlpha_StockTradingPlatform
This is a Java-based console application that simulates a basic stock trading platform. It allows users to view stock prices, buy/sell stocks, and manage their portfolio in a simple and interactive way.   The Stock Trading Platform was built as a beginner-level project to understand how trading systems work on a small scale.
